# opentutor-admin

web ui for grading opentutor sessions

## Usage

A docker image that serves a web client for grading opentutor sessions .

## Variables

In order to function properly the client generally requires these environment variables defined:

- **GRAPHQL_ENDPOINT**: The graphql endpoint for accessing grader data. Defaults to /graphql

## Development

### Running in WSL

Please see the following for setting up Cypress in the wsl

[https://nickymeuleman.netlify.app/blog/gui-on-wsl2-cypress](https://nickymeuleman.netlify.app/blog/gui-on-wsl2-cypress)

### Required Software

- unix system (osx or linux)

- node/npm 16.X lts

- docker

### Initial Setup

Ensure that the node version is set to 12.22.12. This example utilizes nvm to control node versions.

```
nvm use 16.15.1
```

To install all other packages (Main, Client, and Cypress):

```
npm install
```

### Testing

Any changes made to this repo should be covered by tests. This is now covered by Cypress Testing.

To check all required tests before a commit:

```
make test-all
```

All pushed commits must also pass format and lint checks:

```
make format
```
```
make pretty
```
```
make license
```




### Cypress Testing

To run cypress tests locally you need two shells, first make sure the client is running locally:

```
cd client && make develop
```

...then you can run the full cypress test suite with

```
cd cypress && npm run cy:open
```

...then in the cypress browser window, click a spec to run it.

### Cypress Visual-Regression Testing

We use [cypress-image-snapshot](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cypress-image-snapshot) for visual-regression testing.

Generally, you don't want to run the image-snapshot tests while developing because they will fail based on small differences in rendering from environment to environment. For this reason, the default npm commands for `cy:open` and `cy:run` disable image-snapshot testing.

What you *must* do, is update image snapshots before push any changes that change the presentation of the app (at least for screens under visual-regression test).

To update snapshots do:

```
cd client && make cypress-update-snapshots
```

This command updates snapshots, running cypress in the same docker image used for testing in Circleci. It may take a while the first time you run it, because the process needs to install and cache dependencies in a distinct folder (because they will install/compile for the linux flavor in the docker image).

If anything is failing with `make cypress-update-snapshots`, try

```
make clean-cypress-snapshot-cache
```

## Releases

Currently, this image is semantically versioned. When making changes that you want to test in another project, create a branch and PR and then you can release a test tag one of two ways:

To build/push a work-in-progress tag of `opentutor-admin` for the current commit in your branch

- find the `docker_tag_commit` workflow for your commit in [circleci](https://circleci.com/gh/ICTLearningSciences/workflows/opentutor-admin)

- approve the workflow

- this will create a tag like `https://hub.docker.com/opentutor-admin:${COMMIT_SHA}`

To build/push a pre-release semver tag of `opentutor-admin` for the current commit in your branch

- create a [github release](https://github.com/ICTLearningSciences/opentutor-admin/releases/new) **from your development branch** with tag format `/^\d+\.\d+\.\d+(-[a-z\d\-.]+)?$/` (e.g. `1.0.0-alpha.1`)

- find the `docker_tag_release` workflow for your git tag in [circleci](https://circleci.com/gh/ICTLearningSciences/workflows/opentutor-admin)

- approve the workflow

- this will create a tag like `opentutor/opentutor-admin:1.0.0-alpha.1`

Once your changes are approved and merged to main, you should create a release tag in semver format as follows:

- create a [github release](https://github.com/ICTLearningSciences/opentutor-admin/releases/new) **from main** with tag format `/^\d+\.\d+\.\d$/` (e.g. `1.0.0`)

- find the `docker_tag_release` workflow for your git tag in [circleci](https://circleci.com/gh/ICTLearningSciences/workflows/opentutor-admin)

- approve the workflow

- this will create a tag like `opentutor/opentutor-admin:1.0.0`
